#+title: Branfuck Interpreter in Rust

This repository contains my implementation of a brainfuck interpreter written in Rust. To run it, just clone the repository and run ~cargo run [input_file]~ (Ensure that you have [[https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/cargo/][cargo]] installed).

Some example brainfuck programs are included in the ~examples~ directory.

* Brainfuck Instruction Set
#+begin_src text
  > = increases memory pointer, or moves the pointer to the right 1 block.
  < = decreases memory pointer, or moves the pointer to the left 1 block.
  + = increases value stored at the block pointed to by the memory pointer
  - = decreases value stored at the block pointed to by the memory pointer
  [ = like c while(cur_block_value != 0) loop.
  ] = if block currently pointed to's value is not zero, jump back to [
  , = like c getchar(). input 1 character.
  . = like c putchar(). print 1 character to the console
