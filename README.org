#+title: Branfuck Interpreter in Rust

This repository contains my implementation of a brainfuck interpreter written in Rust. To run it, just clone the repository and run ~cargo run [input_file]~ (Ensure that you have [[https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/cargo/][cargo]] installed).

Some example brainfuck programs are included in the ~examples~ directory.

* Brainfuck Instruction Set

| ~>~ | Increment the data pointer (to point to the next cell to the right).                                                                                                              |
| ~<~ | Decrement the data pointer (to point to the next cell to the left).                                                                                                               |
| ~+~ | Increment (increase by one) the byte at the data pointer.                                                                                                                         |
| ~-~ | Decrement (decrease by one) the byte at the data pointer.                                                                                                                         |
| ~.~ | Output the byte at the data pointer.                                                                                                                                              |
| , | Accept one byte of input, storing its value in the byte at the data pointer.                                                                                                      |
| ~[~ | If the byte at the data pointer is zero, then instead of moving the instruction pointer forward to the next command, jump it forward to the command after the matching ] command. |
| ~]~ | If the byte at the data pointer is nonzero, then instead of moving the instruction pointer forward to the next command, jump it back to the command after the matching [ command. |
|     |                                                                                                                                                                                   |
